## Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs
Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is crucial for building high-quality software. A big part of this is to write clean, well-organized code which includes good naming practices of functions and variables and including comments and documentation for the code. By following these methods, I am able to write code that is easily understandable by not only me but by any other developers that may need to work with my code. And, by keeping my code easily understood, it is easier to maintain and alter in the furture as well as adapt to fit future projects. 

Another important part of writing maintainable, readable and adaptable code is to follow good software engineering practices such as encapsulation, modularization, and abstraction. I follow these practices by breaking my code down into more manageable components and by using well-defined interfaces to hide the implementation details. By breaking up the code in this way, it not only becomes more readable, but also easier to maintain and adapt.

My CRUD Python module, which contains the code for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, is an excellent representation of all of the aspects of writing a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program. The code itself is clean and well commented and by decoupling the database access code from the user interface code in this manner, it will be easier to alter the underlying database implementation without having to make changes to the interface code. Not only that but it allows for testing of the database access code in isolation from the interface code. 

By writing the program in this manner, the Python CRUD module can be used in future projects that require database access using Python such as a web application to store data or to perform queries on a large dataset in a data analysis tool. Following these good coding practices allows me to create a good foundation of reusable components that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable in the long term.
